# Welcome to Dance Challenge!
 My Scholarship submission to WWDC 2020.
 
An interactive scene to talk about the theme of _judgment_.
Using mechanics that mix the things that most represent me: Dance, Geek and Games. 

## How it works?
  You will control Caio(me), who wishes to enter the best dance school in the world, but must face members of the school
  and prove that you are worthy to be a student there.
  
The Game has 3 stages: Scenes, battles and decisions.
  
## Scenes
  Presented at the beginning and end of the interactive scene, to present the character's motivation and objectives and outcome 
  at the end of the scene. To continue in the scenes, just tap anywhere on the screen.
  
  
### Battle
  The battle takes place 3 times during the scene, in different difficulties and against different enemies. 
  It is turn-based to set up skill time and choose each competitor.
  You have 3 buttons to battle:
  
  * Simple Attack: Simple attack with no cooldown, given the enemy a basic damage.
  * Defend: Defend the enemy's next strike and reduce damage taken, with 2-turn cooldown.
  * Special Attack: Special attack that takes a lot of damage but contains 2-turn cooldown.
  
## Decisions
  Trim at the end of each battle to represent the important choices of the game. 
  You have 2 buttons to choose from, deciding the direction you want to take according to the opponent's speech.
  
  * Left:Choose to tread the path from the left ◀️ 
  * Right: Choose to tread the path from the right ▶️
  
  The game was made to present and know who to trust and know who wants "your evil" during your life, and always give your best
  regardless of the opinions of those of the people
  
 ## I hope you like it! Thank you!
